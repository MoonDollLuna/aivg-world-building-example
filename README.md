#  Creation of a Visual Novel using Ren'Py to showcase World Building - Practical example
## Group 2 - Artificial Intelligence in Videogames 2019/20

Guide **Group 2**, our protagonist, while doing his riveting assignment for class. Will you make them pass the subject, or will they fail and have to retake it?

This game is a simple example of a Visual Novel, created using Ren'Py (a free Visual Novel creation tool), used to showcase the possibilities of world building when using visual novels.

The game has **four** different endings, reached by taking decisions using a **decision tree** as a representation scheme.

The game is playable by launching *TheVNOdyssey.exe*. The executable needs to be contained within the original folder.

The folder *game* contains all the elements used in the game. The most relevant parts are:
* *game/script.rpy*: contains the full script of the game (dialogues, choices, characters, transitions...). Everything relevant is commented there, so it should be checked.
* *game/images/*: this folder contains all the images and backgrounds used by the game.

The rest of scripts (those finishing in *.rpy*) contain various configurations about the game. It can be interesting to check them, but they were not modified for this assignment.
